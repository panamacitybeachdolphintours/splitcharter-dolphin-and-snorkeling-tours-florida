<div><p>Our split charter for the 13 passenger boat will reserve the boat for you, other groups and the captain. Coast Guard regulations state the maximum passengers allowed is 13, including infants and children.<br />
Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours</p>

<p>Swim with Panama City&rsquo;s resident pod of wild bottle-nosed dolphins<br />
Seeing and swimming with the dolphins in their natural in their natural habitat on your trip aboard super-comfortable boats.</p>

<p>Our boats are actual dive boats so the children will love finding and seeing the dolphins and having the opportunity to snorkel in the water just like a real SCUBA diver.</p>

<p>Unlike the larger tour boats that carry up to 175 people, this Dolphin Tour carries only 6 passengers (children of all ages included). We can have you in the water with your snorkel gear on quickly and without all the noise those large groups create, often scaring the dolphins away.</p>

<p>Your captain will instruct you on the best method of entering the water and seeing the dolphins up close and personal.</p>

<p>Swimming parallel with the dolphins rather than swimming toward them or reaching out for them (this is also illegal), we will allow the dolphins to come to us (best, most ethical method).</p>

<p>Private Dolphin and Snorkeling Tours</p>

<p>Swimming with the Bottle Nose Dolphins<br />
You will enter the water before the dolphins arrive. Using this method the dolphins are more likely to come to us out of curiosity rather than swim away.</p>

<p>The dolphins can be finicky and the more we &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; they are not there, the more curious they become. It&rsquo;s kind of like humans when they are dating, the less you &ldquo;seem to care&rdquo;, the more curious they will become. Mom can explain this phenomena to you easily, because this is likely how she met your dad.</p>

<p>Private Dolphin and Snorkeling Tours</p>

<p>Snorkeling Shell Island in Panama City Beach Florida<br />
For the second portion of the trip you will have the opportunity to discover all the wildlife of St Andrews Bay, including the osprey, pelicans, herons and underwater creatures such as sea horses, starfish, sea urchins, blue crabs, hermit crabs and the other critters who call the waters of Shell Island home. Explore Shell Island for sand dollars and shells. Snorkel grass flats and discover St. Andrews Bay along the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>You will arrive at your snorkeling destination where your captain will get in the water with you and show you how to find seashells and other sea life. Booking this private trip will allow you to make the call the regarding how you would like to spend your tour time to ensure you spend the time exactly as you dreamed it to be.</p>

<p>All snorkeling is waiting for you on the boat AT NO EXTRA CHARGE. You will have access to a cooler on the boat stocked with complimentary bottled water and/or Capri Suns. You are also welcome to bring your own beverages, snacks and BYOB.</p>
